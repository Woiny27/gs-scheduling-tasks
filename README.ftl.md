# Getting Started: Scheduling Tasks


What you'll build
-----------------

This guide walks you through the steps for scheduling tasks with Spring.


What you'll need
----------------

 - About 15 minutes
 - <@prereq_editor_jdk_buildtools/>

<a name="scratch"></a>
Set up the project
------------------

<@build_system_intro/>

<@create_directory_structure_hello/>

### Create a Maven pom

    <@snippet path="pom.xml" prefix="initial"/>

<@bootstrap_starter_pom_disclaimer/>

Create a scheduled task
-----------------------
Now that you've set up your project, you can create a scheduled task.

    <@snippet path="src/main/java/hello/ScheduledTasks.java" prefix="complete"/>

The key components that make this code perform scheduled tasks are the `@EnableScheduling` and `@Scheduled` annotations. 

`@EnableScheduling` ensures that a background task executor is created. Without it, nothing gets scheduled. 

You use `@Scheduled` to configure when a particular method is run.
> **Note:** This example uses `fixedRate`, which specifies the interval between method invocations measured from the start time of each invocation. There are [other options](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.2.2.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/scheduling.html#scheduling-annotation-support-scheduled), like `fixedDelay`, which specifies the interval between invocations measured from the completion of the task. You can also [use `@Scheduled(cron=". . .")` expressions for more sophisticated task scheduling](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.2.x/javadoc-api/org/springframework/scheduling/support/CronSequenceGenerator.html).


Make the application executable
-------------------------------

Although scheduled tasks can be embedded in web apps and WAR files, the simpler approach demonstrated below creates a standalone application. You package everything in a single, executable JAR file, driven by a good old Java `main()` method.

### Create an application class

Here you create a new `SpringApplication` and run it with the `ScheduledTasks` you defined earlier. This action creates a task executor and allows tasks to be scheduled."

    <@snippet path="src/main/java/hello/Application.java" prefix="complete"/>

<@build_an_executable_jar_subhead/>

<@build_an_executable_jar/>


<@run_the_application module="service"/>

Logging output is displayed. You should see your scheduled task fire every 5 seconds:

```sh
[...]
The time is now 13:10:00
The time is now 13:10:05
The time is now 13:10:10
The time is now 13:10:15
```

Summary
-------

Congratulations! You created an application with a scheduled task. Heck, the actual code was shorter than the build file! This technique works in any type of application.
